# ☭ Our Program

> "The C is OURS!"

A meme using C and Linux to express gratitude for the Free Software culture. This program renders the Soviet flag in the terminal while playing the Soviet anthem through raw audio synthesis (RAW/PCM) - no MP3 files involved, just pure mathematics and sound waves. PS: I am NOT a communist.
